The AI engineer successfully developed a complex, full-stack application from an initial problem statement, incrementally adding features across multiple domains. The approach involved systematic phase-based development, frequent user confirmation (all scope), and robust error handling as evidenced by addressing , , and  issues throughout the trajectory. Key decisions included using environment variables for configuration, implementing an Oracle provider interface for hot-swappable API keys, and integrating a comprehensive observability stack (OTEL, Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager). The engineer demonstrated strong command over a diverse tech stack (FastAPI, Redis, Neo4j, Docker, GitHub Actions, Helm), ensuring testability, scalability, and maintainability. The trajectory highlights a thorough implementation, from core logic (Planner, Arena) to operational readiness (CI/CD, monitoring, documentation, developer experience). The work culminated in a deployable MVP meeting all initial requirements.

<product_requirements>
The user requested the extension of a Liquid-Hive-Upgrade repository into a robust, observable, and secure application. The core problem aimed to create a mega-prompt system with swappable API keys and a flexible Oracle provider interface, enabling hot-swapping of keys/providers at runtime without code changes. This system follows Twelve-Factor principles and is compatible with Vault/OTEL conventions.

The implementation covered:
1.  **Planner + DAG Executor**: A system for defining and executing task graphs.
2.  **Evaluation Arena Service**: A FastAPI service for submitting, comparing, and ranking model responses, using Redis/Neo4j for storage.
3.  **Observability**: Grafana dashboards, Prometheus integration, and Alertmanager rules for API metrics, training, and infrastructure. OTEL traces/metrics for provider calls.
4.  **CI/CD**: GitHub workflows for testing, Docker image building/pushing to GHCR, and manual SSH deployment.
5.  **Security/Tenancy**: JWT/API-key authentication, per-tenant quotas, secrets from Vault/Secrets Manager, and signed audit trails.
6.  **Swappable Providers**: An  interface with adapters for various LLMs (DeepSeek, OpenAI, Anthropic, Qwen), configurable via  and environment variables, with runtime hot-reload capability.
7.  **API Contract & SDKs**: Pinned OpenAPI JSON, typed Python/JS SDKs.
8.  **Golden Data**: Seed tasks and a curator CLI for Arena fuel.
9.  **Cost/Routing Control**: Economic routing lattice with profiles (cheap, balanced, quality) and fallbacks.
10. **DX/Ops & Deployment**: Common targets:
  make install            # install Python deps
  make test               # run fast unit tests (planner + arena)
  make test-all           # run full test suite
  make openapi            # export OpenAPI to docs/openapi.json
  make docker-build       # build Docker image
  make docker-run         # run Docker image locally
  make helm-install       # install Helm chart
  make helm-uninstall     # uninstall Helm release
  make precommit-install  # install pre-commit git hooks
  make lint               # run ruff checks
  make format             # run formatters (ruff, black, isort if available) targets, pre-commit hooks, hardened Docker images, semantic-release, Helm charts, and comprehensive documentation.
