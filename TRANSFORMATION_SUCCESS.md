## 🔧 GIT ISSUE RESOLUTION

### **Problem Identified:**
- During cleanup, moved Git pack file (`pack-7ae743da8f6296bc5c8dbc2d0bb8c05b96ebeda4.pack`) to `assets_large/`
- This corrupted Git repository integrity, causing push failures
- Git couldn't read essential objects needed for repository history

### **Solution Applied:**
1. ✅ **Restored Git pack file** to `.git/objects/pack/`
2. ✅ **Fixed reflog corruption** with `git reflog expire` and `git gc`
3. ✅ **Verified Git operations** - commits, status, log all working
4. ✅ **Repository integrity** confirmed with successful test operations

**Result**: Git repository is now healthy and ready for push operations
