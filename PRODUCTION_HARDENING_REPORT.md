- Created comprehensive `CHANGELOG.md` with conventional commits
- Implemented automated release process with:
  - Python package distribution
  - Docker image publishing
  - Frontend bundle generation
  - Release notes automation

### ✅ 11. Documentation
- Created comprehensive documentation structure:
  - **GETTING_STARTED.md**: 5-minute setup guide
  - **OPERATIONS.md**: Production deployment and scaling
  - **ARCHITECTURE.md**: System design and technical details
- Added auto-generated API documentation support
- Created development workflow documentation

### ✅ 12. Development Automation
