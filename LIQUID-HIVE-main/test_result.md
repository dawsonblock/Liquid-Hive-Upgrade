# LIQUID-HIVE Testing Protocol

## Testing Protocol
- MUST test BACKEND first using `deep_testing_backend_v2`
- After backend testing is done, STOP to ask the user whether to test frontend or not
- NEVER invoke `auto_frontend_testing_agent` without explicit user permission
- NEVER fix something which has already been fixed by testing agents
- ALWAYS take MINIMUM number of steps when editing this file
