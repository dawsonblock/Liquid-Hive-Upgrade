The AI engineer successfully guided the LIQUID-HIVE project through two major phases: building the Cerebral GUI and implementing the Aegis operational hardening, followed by initial steps into the Post-Launch Roadmap. The process was iterative, involving significant backend modifications (FastAPI, Redis leader election, Prometheus integration), frontend development (React, MUI, Redux), and extensive infrastructure setup via Helm charts (Kubernetes deployments, monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana, PVCs). The AI diligently addressed all explicit requests, including CI/CD pipelines with comprehensive testing (lint, unit, E2E Kind, observability), and critical pre-launch fixes for configuration brittleness, ephemeral state, and split-brain autonomy. Subsequently, it began implementing Tier-4 enhancements, delivering a Prometheus-driven Resource Estimator, XAI rationale surfacing in the GUI, a multimodal learning data pipeline, a shadow-mode Trust Protocol, and, crucially, automated adapter promotion with a preview endpoint and dynamic model routing, all carefully feature-flagged for safety.

The LIQUID-HIVE project required building the Cerebral GUI, a React-TypeScript SPA using Material-UI, Redux, Axios, and WebSockets. This GUI needed to interact with the existing FastAPI backend, displaying Operator Intent, RAG context, and Reasoning Strategy; managing an Approval Queue with real-time updates; and providing controls for training, adapter deployment (promote/demote), and Arbiter Governor configuration.

Following the GUI, the Aegis Operational Hardening directive mandated:
1.  **CI/CD Workflow**: GitHub Actions for linting, backend/frontend testing, and Docker image build/push on / branches.
2.  **Comprehensive Testing**: Pytest for backend API/autonomy; Jest/React Testing Library for frontend components.
3.  **Production-Grade Helm Chart**: Deploy the entire stack (API, Redis, Neo4j, vLLM, Prometheus, Grafana, Redis Exporter) with configurable values, PVCs, and ingress.
4.  **Developer Experience**:  and  for code quality.

Finally, the Post-Launch Roadmap outlined Tier-4 enhancements:
1.  **Economic Hardening**: Prometheus-driven Resource Estimator, Dynamic Model Routing for vLLM.
2.  **Cognitive Deepening & Explainability**: Surface StrategySelector reasons and Judge critiques in GUI, close Multi-Modal Learning Loop (VL SFT).
3.  **Operational Excellence**: Automate Champion/Challenger lifecycle, Production-Grade Secrets Management.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on enabling and hardening the Auto-Promotion feature and Dynamic Model Routing.

**Auto-Promotion:**
The auto-promotion loop is now fully implemented and active in the  file. It operates under strict guardrails: it only runs on the Redis-elected leader instance (preventing split-brain), fetches live metrics from Prometheus (request rates, p95 latency histograms), and uses the  to compare champion and challenger adapter costs. A challenger is promoted if it demonstrates a clear superiority (â‰¥10% better in p95 latency or cost) while respecting minimum sample sizes and a configurable cooldown period (e.g., 24 hours). This feature is configured via Helm values (, , ) and environment variables.

To enhance operator visibility and control, a  endpoint was added. This endpoint allows operators to see which adapters would be promoted currently, along with their comparative metrics, without actually triggering any action. Additionally, successful auto-promotions now broadcast real-time  via WebSocket, which the frontend's  listens for to display toast notifications.

**Dynamic Model Routing:**
The infrastructure for dynamic model routing has been scaffolded.  now includes  and optional / fields.  has logic to instantiate separate VLLM clients for small and large models if their endpoints are configured. In the  endpoint, the system can now use the 's  (if provided) or a simple heuristic (e.g., short, simple queries go to 'small') to select which VLLM client (roles object) to use for generating responses. This is controlled by the  Helm flag and relies on the  and  Helm templates for deploying separate vLLM services.

**Overall State:**
The system's core has been significantly hardened, with configuration brittleness eliminated, state persistence via PVCs, and split-brain autonomy prevented. The Cerebral GUI is functional, displaying decision rationale and ready for judge critiques. Initial steps into the Post-Launch Roadmap for Economic Hardening (Resource Estimator), XAI (rationale surfacing), Multimodal Learning (VL dataset build), and Trust Protocol (shadow mode Confidence Modeler) are also in place, all feature-flagged for safe, incremental deployment.
