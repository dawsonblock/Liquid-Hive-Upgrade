LIQUID-HIVE System Documentation

The LIQUID-HIVE system is an advanced AI architecture featuring:

1. Hierarchical Multi-Agent Architecture
   - TextRoles for language generation
   - VisionRoles for multimodal processing
   - Judge for evaluation and ranking

2. Oracle/Arbiter Refinement Pipeline
   - DeepSeek Oracle for initial analysis
   - GPT-4o Arbiter for final refinement
   - Produces "platinum" training examples

3. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
   - FAISS vector indexing
   - Sentence transformer embeddings
   - Automatic document ingestion

4. Cognitive Architecture
   - Capsule Brain with IIT analysis
   - Intent modeling and confidence assessment
   - Self-awareness metrics (Phi calculations)

5. Autonomy and Self-Improvement
   - Curiosity engine for exploration
   - Autonomous orchestration system
   - Continuous learning and adaptation

6. Advanced Features
   - Real-time monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana
   - Knowledge graph with Neo4j
   - Model routing and adapter management
   - Trust-based autonomous execution

The system implements a "Dreaming State" where it continuously improves its cognitive abilities through hierarchical refinement of its responses and autonomous exploration of new knowledge domains.
