Programming Concepts and Best Practices

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which contain data (attributes) and code (methods). Key principles include:
- Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods together
- Inheritance: Creating new classes based on existing ones
- Polymorphism: Objects of different types responding to the same interface
- Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details

Functional Programming
Functional programming treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions. Key concepts:
- Pure functions: Functions with no side effects
- Immutability: Data that doesn't change after creation
- Higher-order functions: Functions that operate on other functions
- Recursion: Functions calling themselves

Design Patterns
Common solutions to recurring design problems:
- Singleton: Ensures a class has only one instance
- Factory: Creates objects without specifying exact classes
- Observer: Notifies multiple objects about state changes
- Strategy: Encapsulates algorithms and makes them interchangeable

Best Practices
- Write clean, readable code
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Follow the DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Implement proper error handling
- Write comprehensive tests
- Use version control effectively
- Document your code appropriately

Asynchronous Programming
Modern applications often need to handle multiple tasks concurrently:
- Async/await patterns for non-blocking operations
- Event loops for managing asynchronous operations
- Promises and futures for handling delayed results
- Thread pools and task queues for parallel processing
