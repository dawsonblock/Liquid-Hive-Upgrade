        Artificial Intelligence Fundamentals

        Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines
        that are programmed to think and learn. Machine learning is a subset of AI that
        uses statistical techniques to enable machines to improve with experience.

        Key concepts include:
        - Neural networks: Computing systems inspired by biological neural networks
        - Deep learning: Machine learning with multi-layered neural networks
        - Natural language processing: AI's ability to understand human language
        - Computer vision: AI's ability to interpret visual information

        Applications of AI include autonomous vehicles, recommendation systems,
        medical diagnosis, and intelligent assistants.
