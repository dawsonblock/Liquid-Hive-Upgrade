They consist of interconnected nodes neurons that process and transmit information. ### Deep Learning Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple hidden layers. Its particularly effective for tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition. ### Transformer Architecture Transformers are a neural network architecture that has revolutionized natural language processing. They use self-attention mechanisms to process sequential data in parallel, making them highly efficient for training. ## Applications - **Natural Language Processing**: Text generation, translation, sentiment analysis - **Computer Vision**: Image classification, object detection, image generation - **Robotics**: Path planning, manipulation, autonomous navigation - **Healthcare**: Medical diagnosis, drug discovery, personalized treatment ## The Future of AI Artificial intelligence continues to evolve rapidly, with new breakthroughs in areas like: - Large Language Models LLMs - Multimodal AI systems - AI safety and alignment - Autonomous agents and systems",

    "page_content": "Programming Concepts and Best Practices Object-Oriented Programming OOP OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which contain data attributes and code methods. Key principles include: - Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods together - Inheritance: Creating new classes based on existing ones - Polymorphism: Objects of different types responding to the same interface - Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details Functional Programming Functional programming treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions. Key concepts: - Pure functions: Functions with no side effects - Immutability: Data that doesnt change after creation - Higher-order functions: Functions that operate on other functions - Recursion: Functions calling themselves Design Patterns Common solutions to recurring design problems: - Singleton: Ensures a class has only one instance - Factory: Creates objects without specifying exact classes - Observer: Notifies multiple objects about state changes - Strategy: Encapsulates algorithms and makes them interchangeable Best Practices - Write clean, readable code - Use meaningful variable and function names - Follow the DRY principle Dont Repeat Yourself - Implement proper error handling - Write comprehensive tests - Use version control effectively - Document your code appropriately Asynchronous Programming Modern applications often need to handle multiple tasks concurrently: - Asyncawait patterns for non-blocking operations - Event loops for managing asynchronous operations - Promises and futures for handling delayed results - Thread pools and task queues for parallel processing",
