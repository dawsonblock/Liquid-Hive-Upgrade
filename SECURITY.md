## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Liquid-Hive seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 🔒 Private Disclosure

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please:

1. **Email**: Send details to [security@example.com] (replace with actual contact)
2. **Subject**: `[SECURITY] Liquid-Hive Vulnerability Report`
3. **Include**:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Your contact information

### 📝 What to Include

- **Vulnerability Type**: Authentication, Authorization, SQL Injection, XSS, etc.
- **Affected Components**: Backend API, Frontend, Database, Infrastructure
- **Severity**: Critical, High, Medium, Low
- **Proof of Concept**: Code, screenshots, or steps to demonstrate
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have recommendations

### ⏱️ Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Investigation**: 1-2 weeks for assessment
- **Fix Development**: 2-4 weeks depending on complexity
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is deployed and tested

### 🏆 Recognition

We appreciate security researchers who help us maintain a secure platform:

- Security hall of fame (with permission)
- Acknowledgment in release notes
- Potential bug bounty (TBD based on severity)

### 🛡️ Security Features

Current security measures in Liquid-Hive:

- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with secure token handling
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **HTTPS**: All communications encrypted in transit
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning via Dependabot
- **Static Analysis**: Security linting with bandit and ESLint security rules
- **Container Security**: Minimal base images and non-root execution
- **Secrets Management**: Environment-based secrets (no hardcoded credentials)

### 🔍 Security Testing

We regularly perform:

- Automated dependency vulnerability scans
- Static code analysis (bandit, ESLint security plugins)
- Container image vulnerability scanning
- Penetration testing (periodic)

### 📋 Security Checklist for Contributors

When contributing code:

- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- [ ] Input validation on all user inputs
- [ ] Proper error handling (no sensitive info in errors)
- [ ] Authentication/authorization checks where needed
- [ ] Dependencies are up-to-date and secure
- [ ] Follow principle of least privilege
- [ ] Security linting passes (bandit, ESLint security rules)

### 🚨 Known Security Considerations

- **AI/ML Models**: Ensure model inputs are sanitized to prevent prompt injection
- **File Uploads**: Validate file types, scan for malware, restrict sizes
- **Database**: Use parameterized queries, limit permissions
- **APIs**: Rate limiting, input validation, secure headers
- **Frontend**: XSS protection, CSP headers, secure cookies
