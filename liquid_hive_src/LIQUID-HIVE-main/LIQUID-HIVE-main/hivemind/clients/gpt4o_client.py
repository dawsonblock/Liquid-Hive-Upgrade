"""
GPT-4o Client
==============

This module defines a minimal asynchronous client for the GPT-4o model from
OpenAI.  The client follows the same interface as other model clients in
this repository.  Authentication is managed via the ``OPENAI_API_KEY``
environment variable.  Error handling and retry logic are implemented to
provide resilience in the face of transient failures.  In a production
deployment you should replace the stubbed ``generate`` method with calls
to the OpenAI API.

Example usage::

    from .gpt4o_client import GPT4oClient
    client = GPT4oClient()
    response = await client.generate(system_prompt, user_prompt)

The returned value is a raw string that downstream modules should parse
into JSON.

    The client exposes a single ``generate`` method that accepts a system
    prompt and a user prompt and returns the model's response.  This
    implementation avoids dependencies on the official OpenAI Python SDK
    so that it can run in restricted environments.  In a full deployment
    you should replace the stubbed logic with real API calls.
