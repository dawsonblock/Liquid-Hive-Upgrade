# LIQUID-HIVE Testing Protocol

## Testing Protocol
- MUST test BACKEND first using `deep_testing_backend_v2`
- After backend testing is done, STOP to ask the user whether to test frontend or not
- NEVER invoke `auto_frontend_testing_agent` without explicit user permission
- NEVER fix something which has already been fixed by testing agents
- ALWAYS take MINIMUM number of steps when editing this file

## Test Results Summary

- [x] Secrets health endpoint added to FastAPI server
- [x] Helm charts created for production deployment
- [x] Documentation created (/app/docs/SECRETS_MANAGEMENT.md)

### Next Steps:
1. Add required dependencies (hvac, boto3)
2. Create secrets management service
3. Update hivemind/config.py
4. Update Helm charts
5. Test backend integration
