# ADR-001: Technology Stack Selection

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We needed to select a comprehensive technology stack for Liquid-Hive-Upgrade that would support:

1. **High-performance API server** capable of handling thousands of concurrent requests
2. **Multi-provider LLM integration** with hot-swappable configurations
3. **Complex task planning and execution** with DAG-based workflows
4. **Model evaluation and comparison** platform
5. **Enterprise-grade security** with authentication and authorization
6. **Production observability** with metrics, tracing, and alerting
7. **Container-native deployment** with Kubernetes support
8. **Developer experience** with modern tooling and practices

## Decision

We have selected the following technology stack:

### Backend Framework: FastAPI (Python)

**Rationale:**

- **Performance**: One of the fastest Python web frameworks
- **Type Safety**: Built-in Pydantic integration for request/response validation
- **Async Support**: Native async/await support for concurrent operations
- **OpenAPI**: Automatic API documentation generation
- **Ecosystem**: Rich Python ecosystem for ML/AI integrations

**Alternatives Considered:**

- **Flask**: Simpler but less performant and fewer built-in features
- **Django**: More opinionated, heavier for API-only services
- **Node.js/Express**: Good performance but Python better for ML ecosystem
- **Go/Gin**: Excellent performance but steeper learning curve for team

### Frontend Framework: React with TypeScript

**Rationale:**

- **Type Safety**: TypeScript provides compile-time error checking
- **Ecosystem**: Massive ecosystem of components and libraries
- **Developer Experience**: Excellent tooling and debugging support
- **Performance**: Virtual DOM and modern React features
- **Team Expertise**: Team familiarity with React/TypeScript

**Alternatives Considered:**

- **Vue.js**: Good but smaller ecosystem than React
- **Angular**: More opinionated, steeper learning curve
- **Svelte**: Excellent performance but smaller community
- **Plain JavaScript**: No type safety, harder to maintain

### Database Stack: Multi-Database Architecture

#### Primary Database: MongoDB

**Rationale:**

- **Flexible Schema**: Document model fits varied data structures
- **Scalability**: Built-in sharding and replica sets
- **Developer Experience**: Intuitive query language
- **JSON Native**: Perfect for API-first applications

#### Cache Layer: Redis

**Rationale:**

- **Performance**: In-memory operations with sub-millisecond latency
- **Data Structures**: Rich data types beyond simple key-value
- **Persistence**: Configurable persistence for durability
- **Clustering**: Built-in clustering for horizontal scaling

#### Graph Database: Neo4j

**Rationale:**

- **Relationship Modeling**: Native graph operations
- **Query Language**: Cypher for complex relationship queries
- **Performance**: Optimized for graph traversals
- **Analytics**: Graph Data Science library

#### Vector Database: Qdrant

**Rationale:**

- **Performance**: Rust-based implementation for speed
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling with collections
- **API**: Both REST and gRPC interfaces
- **Features**: HNSW indexing and quantization support

**Alternatives Considered:**

- **PostgreSQL**: Excellent but relational model limiting for some use cases
- **MySQL**: Mature but less flexible than document databases
- **Elasticsearch**: Good for search but not optimal for general data storage
- **Pinecone**: Managed vector DB but vendor lock-in concerns

### Container Platform: Docker + Kubernetes

**Rationale:**

- **Standardization**: Industry standard for containerization
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes provides robust orchestration
- **Scaling**: Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)
- **Security**: Pod security policies and network policies
- **Ecosystem**: Rich ecosystem of operators and tools

**Alternatives Considered:**

- **Docker Swarm**: Simpler but less feature-rich than Kubernetes
- **Nomad**: Good alternative but smaller ecosystem
- **VM-based deployment**: Less efficient resource utilization
- **Serverless**: Good for specific workloads but not for stateful services

### Observability Stack: Prometheus + Grafana + OpenTelemetry

**Rationale:**

- **Standards-based**: OpenTelemetry is becoming the standard
- **Prometheus**: De facto standard for metrics in Kubernetes
- **Grafana**: Excellent visualization capabilities
- **Integration**: Native Kubernetes integration
- **Cost**: Open source alternatives to expensive commercial solutions

**Alternatives Considered:**

- **DataDog**: Excellent but expensive for large scale
- **New Relic**: Good APM but vendor lock-in
- **Elastic Stack**: Good for logging but Prometheus better for metrics
- **Cloud Provider Tools**: Good but creates vendor lock-in

### Build and Deployment: GitHub Actions + Helm

**Rationale:**

- **Integration**: Native GitHub integration
- **Cost**: Free for open source projects
- **Ecosystem**: Large marketplace of actions
- **Helm**: Standard for Kubernetes application deployment
- **GitOps**: Enables GitOps workflows

**Alternatives Considered:**

- **Jenkins**: More powerful but complex setup and maintenance
- **GitLab CI**: Good but we're using GitHub for source control
- **CircleCI**: Good but additional cost and complexity
- **Cloud Provider CI/CD**: Creates vendor lock-in

### Code Quality Tools: Ruff + MyPy + ESLint + Prettier

**Rationale:**

- **Performance**: Ruff is extremely fast compared to alternatives
- **Type Safety**: MyPy provides static type checking for Python
- **Standardization**: ESLint/Prettier are JavaScript/TypeScript standards
- **Integration**: Excellent IDE and CI/CD integration

**Alternatives Considered:**

- **Pylint**: More comprehensive but much slower than Ruff
- **Black**: Good formatter but Ruff includes formatting
- **Flake8**: Popular but being superseded by Ruff
- **JSHint/JSLint**: Older tools, ESLint is more modern

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Performance**: Stack optimized for high-performance operations
2. **Scalability**: All components designed for horizontal scaling
3. **Developer Experience**: Modern tooling with excellent debugging support
4. **Type Safety**: TypeScript and MyPy provide compile-time error checking
5. **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring and alerting capabilities
6. **Security**: Enterprise-grade security features built-in
7. **Community Support**: All technologies have strong communities
8. **Documentation**: Extensive documentation and learning resources

### Negative

1. **Complexity**: Multi-database architecture increases operational complexity
2. **Learning Curve**: Team needs to learn multiple technologies
3. **Operational Overhead**: More services to monitor and maintain
4. **Resource Usage**: Multiple databases require more resources
5. **Vendor Diversity**: Multiple vendors/projects to track for updates

### Risks and Mitigations

1. **Technology Churn Risk**:

   - **Risk**: Rapid changes in the ecosystem
   - **Mitigation**: Choose mature, stable versions and pin dependencies

2. **Operational Complexity**:

   - **Risk**: Difficult to operate multiple database systems
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive documentation and automation

3. **Performance Risk**:

   - **Risk**: Multi-database queries could impact performance
   - **Mitigation**: Careful query optimization and caching strategies

4. **Security Risk**:
   - **Risk**: More components mean larger attack surface
   - **Mitigation**: Regular security audits and updates
