LAVA Client
===========

This module provides a minimal client class for interacting with the LiquidAI
LAVA model (e.g. ``LiquidAI/LAVA-1.6B``).  The class mirrors the API of
``VLClient`` but can be extended to call a separate inference endpoint or
service optimised for visual reasoning and instruction following.

In this repository we implement a simple wrapper around ``VLClient`` to
maintain compatibility in constrained environments where the actual LAVA
model is not available.  In production you should replace the ``generate``
method with calls to your dedicated LAVA inference service.
