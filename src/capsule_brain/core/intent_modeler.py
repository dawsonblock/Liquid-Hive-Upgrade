"""
Intent modeler
==============

This module defines an ``IntentModeler`` service that periodically analyses
the history of user prompts stored in the CapsuleEngine and synthesises a
long‑term goal representation.  The intent is stored as a special node in
the knowledge graph and can be used by the proactive and retrieval
modules to prioritise context relevant to the operator's current
objectives.

The implementation here is intentionally minimal; it uses simple
heuristics to derive a single sentence summarising the user's goals from
their recent prompts.  In a production system this would call out to a
powerful LLM with a specialised prompt.
